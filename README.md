# DESCRIPTION

These instructions are to be used to build SwitchCraft on a Raspberry Pi.
More information at http://switchcraft-nft.io/landing
Additional tutorials to build a button for SwitchCraft using a Nano board can be found at https://github.com/Aurian-Nogues/switchcraft_nano

## Install a fresh Raspberry Pi OS to a micro SD card
* Go to https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ to downlaod Raspberry Pi Imager
* Choose Raspberry Pi OS and install it on the SD card
* When finished, install the card in your Pi and boot it
* Plug an HDMI monitor, keyboard and mouse to the Pi to start setup

## Setup your Raspberry Pi
* Follow all instructions to make initial Pi setup (update, wifi setting, etc)

## Install all required Linux packages
* Open a terminal (CTRL + ALT + T)
* Type the following commands:
```
sudo apt install network-manager
sudo apt install libgirepository1.0-dev
sudo apt install libcairo2-dev
```
We use Selenium to display the NFTs through Chromium.
However, Chromium drivers recommended by Selenium do not work with the Pi ARM chips.
Use this command to install the right ARM drivers for Chromium
```
sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
```

## Setup network parameters
We need to change network settings so Linux network can be controlled by our Python scripts (and indirectly bluetooth).
This will prevent you from "manually" changing network settings.

### prevent normal network manager
Here we configure dhcpcd to ignore wlan0
To avoid issues with duplicate instances of wpa_supplicant preventing NetworkManager to work properly, we need to modify the default settings. If we kept the setting as is, the wpa_supplicant will be called twice. The first instance will be called by the wpa_supplicant.service, the second one will be executed by dhcpcd deamon. 

Type this command to open the text editor:
```
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```
Add the following line at the end of the file:
```
denyinterfaces wlan0
```
prexx CTRL + X -> Y to save and close

### confiugure network manager to control wlan0
Type this command to open the text editor:
```
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```
Replace the file content with these lines:
```
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile
dhcp=internal
    
[ifupdown]
managed=true
```
prexx CTRL + X -> Y to save and close

Restart the Pi for modifications to take effect
```
sudo reboot
```
If this worked, you should only see one instance of wpa_supplicant when running this command:
```
ps axu | grep supplicant
```

## Setup SwitchCraft packages
### Copy repo
Open a new terminal and copy the code repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Aurian-Nogues/switchcraft_pi.git
```

### setup Python environment
Navigate to the repo
```
cd switchcraft_pi
```
Create a Python virtual environment. This will enable us to install all the packages we need isolated from the rest of our OS so we have a clean environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install all necessary packages
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### get scripts to automatically start when the Pi starts

#### start scripts before desktop starts
take mainPrgrm.service file from switchcraft_pi
copy to /etc/systemd/system
# need to add command here

```
sudo systemctl enable mainPrgm
sudo systemctl start mainPrgm
```

for lxsession:
```
sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
```
add at the end:
```
@lxterminal -e "/home/pi/switchcraft_pi/execute.sh"
```
then:
```
chmod 644 all scripts and files to execute
```

# Cleanup the Pi startup sequence so it boots nicely into SwitchCraft

install prerequisites
```
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg x11-xserver-utils xinit openbox
```

## Disable screensavers and power management
Edit autostart file:
```
sudo nano /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart
```
Insert those lines:
```
xset s off
xset s noblank
xset -dpms
```

## Disable starting logs and replace them with a boot video

### Rainbow screen
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
add the last line at very end
```
disable_splash=1
```

### change output of pi console
```
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```
In this file you will finde a string of parameters all in line 1. Its important that you add the following exactly at the end of the existing line 1, starting with a space between the exisitng and new. So lets add:
```
consoleblank=1 logo.nologo quiet loglevel=0 plymouth.enable=0 vt.global_cursor_default=0 plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles splash fastboot noatime nodiratime noram
```

### boot with video or splash screen
```
sudo apt-get install omxplayer
```

Next we tell the pi in the rc.local to play our video on boot:
```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
In rc.local add before the end where it says exit 0 these two lines. Don‘t forget to replace my path to the video with yours. You can use all kind of formats, avi, mp4 and more should all work fine as well.
```
dmesg --console-off
omxplayer /home/pi/myvideo.mp4 &
```

### finish
```
sudo reboot
```
You should get a clean boot

### hide mouse
```
sudo apt-get install unclutter
```

add unclutter -idle 0 & at beginning of bash script


## Debugging / tinkering
The Pi will now auto boot into a full screen kiosk mode with the NFTs you want to display
If you ever need to access the Pi, you can plug a Keyboard and hit ALT + F4 to exit the web browser
However, the Python scripts will continue running in the background. To shut them down find them using:
```
ps -ef | grep python
```
Then kill them using
```
sudo kill 9 <script number>

```
